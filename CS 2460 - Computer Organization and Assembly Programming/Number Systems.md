## What are the number systems?
- used to count, measure, assign values
- most common systems:
	- decimal
	- binary
	- hexadecimal
	- octal

## About number systems
- number systems have a base
	- decimal = base 10
		- 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
	- binary = base 2
		- 0, 1
	- hexadecimal = base 16
	- octal = base 8
- place value for each system starts at the base to the power of 0
	- 2$^0$, 10$^0$

## Decimal System
- place value is greatest left to right
	- thousands, hundreds, tens, ones
	- increases by a factor of 10

#### Example: 123
= 1(10$^2$) + 2(10$^1$) + 3(10$^0$)
= 1(100) + 2(10) + 3(1)
= 100 + 20 + 3
= 123

## Binary System
- uses 0 and 1
	- 1 = "on", 0 = "off"
- place value in binary
	- left-most bit = most significant bit (msb)
	- right-most bit = least significant bit (lsb)
	- place value increases by a factor of 2

###  Binary Sample Place Value Chart
- The value of a digit can either be 0 or 2$^x$ where x is the place value

| 128 | 64  | 32  | 16  | 8   | 4   | 2   | 1   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2$^7$ | 2$^6$ | 2$^5$ | 2$^4$ | 2$^3$   | 2$^2$    | 2$^1$    |  2$^0$   |
