How to represent negative integers in the binary?

signed magnitude

1's complement
- to get 1's complement, invert the given number
- range of numbers: for a register of k bits...
	- positive largest number is (2^(k-1) - 1)
	- negative smallest number is -(2^(k-1) - 1)
- Example
	- k = 7
	- positive largest number is (2^(7-1) - 1) = 63
	- negative smallest number is .-(2^(7-1) - 1) = -63
- Example for 1's complement
  For an 8 bit register, find the decimal value of the following binary numbers by hand
	- (0)0010111 (positive remains unchanged)
		- +((2^4) + (2^2) + (2^1) + (2^0)) = 23
	- 01100100
		- 
	- (1)0111101
		- (01000010)
		- (2^6) + (2^1)
		- -66
	- (1)0000000
		- 01111111 (invert cause it's negative)
		- (2^6) + (2^5) ... + (2^0)
		- -something
	- More notes on 1's complement
	- no explicit sign bit
- 2's complement
	- to get 2's complement, first invert the given number, then add 1
	- range of numbers:
		- positive larget number: (2^(k-1) -1)
		- negative smallest number is -(2^(k-1))
		- positive largest number is = 63
		- negative smallest number is = -64

- similar to 1's complement
- fixed length representation
- no explicit sign bit
- due to range of numbers
	- exactly as many positive numbers as negative numbers
	- asymmetry - one neg number with no positive counterpart
	- zero? fixes 0 representation issue
- Rules on 2's complement
	- overflow
	- subtraction
- use 1's complement
	- 37
	- 34
- use 2's complement

- More terms to know
	- asset: what we care about:
		- info, software, hardware, bandwidth, reputation, privacy, money
	- threat
		- potential for an occurence that would cause an undesirable effect on an asset
		- often evaluated with respect to CIA triad
	- safeguard
		- a control implemented to reduce the risk posed by a threat
	- vulnerability
		- the absence or weakness of safeguards, allowing a threat to affect an asset
	- exploit
		- a technique that takes advantage of a specific vulnerability to achieve some effect of an asset
- Threats and Safeguards
	- Example Threats
		- C - packet sniffing, file grabbing
		- I - spoofed e-mails, disk drive corruption
		- A - DoS attacks, power failure
	- Example Safeguards
		- encryption
		- access controls

		- digital signatures
		- backups

		- firewall; redundant capability
		- backup generator
- Cost-Benefit and Risk
	- Principle
		- do not devote more resources than the potential loss
	- Cost of Loss
		- How much does it cost if i fail to maintain CIA?
		- Do not ignore secondary costs
	- Cost of prevention
		- How much does it cost to provide safeguards?
	- Risk assessment and Risk management
	- military and business often have different imperatives for acceptable risks and costs
- Security Fundamentals
	- What is the most secure system?
	- What safeguards would be put in place?
- Secure systems
	- "The only truly secure system is one that is powered off, cast in a block of concrete and sealed in a lead-lined room with armed guards"
	- one that is private, completely air-gapped and shielded from all frequencies, one that stays updated and provides patches if needed, one with multiple firewalls, encrypted connections, military systems
		- trade-offs between security and usability
		- security is a process, not a product
		- perfectly secure systems don't exist, but we can make them more defensible
