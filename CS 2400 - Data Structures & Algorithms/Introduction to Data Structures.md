Data structures - a particular way to store and organize data so that it can be used efficiently
	Good data structure can make massive savings in computation time and space

_7 DS
- 5 Linear DS
- 2 Non Linear DS

Data Structures Examples IRL
- Standing in line
- stacks of books
- to-do list
- dictionary
- road mapp

Collection contains a group of objects
- Bag
	- an unordered collection that allows duplicates
	- order of data items in bag doesn't matter
- List
	- numbers its items
	- order matters <= operations
- Queue
	- order their items chronologically
	- FIFO
		- First In First Out
- Stacks
	- order their items chronologically
	- LIFO or FILO
		- Last In First Out
		- First In Last Out
- Dictionary
	- contains pairs of items
	- collection of data items
		- each data item (key, value)

	- Each of them is a collection that stores its entries in a linear sequence, and in which entries may be added or removed at will
	- They differ in the restrictions they place on how these entries may be added, removed or accessed

- Tree and Graph
	- data entries are not arranged in a sequence, but with different rules
- Tree
	- organizes its entries according to some hierarchy
- Graph
	- a generalization of the ADT tree that focuses on the relationship among its entries instead of any hierarchical organization

To represent real world objects into computer programs, consider:
- What data we want to store?
- What operations we want on the data?
- How to store the data?***
- How to implement the operations?***

Data Structures is an implementation of an ADT with a programming language, which focuses on the concrete issues of implementations

ADT => Data Structures

An ADT makes a clean separation between interface and implementation
	- the user only sees the interface and therefore does not need to tamper with the implementation
	- the abstraction makes the code more robust and easier to maintain

What is an algorithm?
- a procedure
- a finite set of well-defined instructions, for solving a problem which, given an initial state, will terminate in a defined end-state

- the computation complexity and efficient implementation of the algorithm are important in computing, and this depends on suitable data structures

- efficiency of algorithms
	- running time (time complexity)
	- memory cost (space complexity)

How do I choose the right data structures?
- one of the first steps to writing a program is determining or choosing the data structures
- What are the "right" data structures for the program?
	- the interface of operations supported by a data structure is one factor to consider when choosing between several available data structures
	- the efficiency of the structure: how much space does the data structure occupy, and what are the running times of the operations in its interface? is another factor

Moving Algorithm into Development
- the development process
	- specification of the task
	- design of a solution
	- implementation (coding) of the solution
	- analysis of the solution
	- testing and debugging
	- maintenance
