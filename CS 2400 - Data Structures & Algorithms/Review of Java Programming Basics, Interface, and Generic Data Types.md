Objected-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- views a program as a sort of world consisting of objects that interact with one another by means of actions
- Procedural vs Objected Oriented

Class
- specifies the kind of data the objects of that class have and what actions the objects can take and how they accomplish those actions
	- ie: in a program that simulates automobiles, each automobile is an object

Objects in a Java program interact, and this interaction forms solution to a given problem
