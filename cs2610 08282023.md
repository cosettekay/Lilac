NIST Definition of computer security:
- measures and controls that ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information system assets including hardware, software, firmware, and information being processed, stored, and communicated

confidentiality
- preserving authorized restrictions on information access and disclosure, including means for protecting personal privacy and proprietary information
integrity
- guarding against improper information modification or destruction, including ensuring information nonrepudiation and authenticity
availability
- ensuring timely and reliable access to and use of information

Levels of Impact
- low
	- the loss could be expected to have a limited adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals
- moderate
	- the loss could be expected to have a serious adverse effect on organization operations, organization assets, or individuals
- high
	- the loss could be expected to have a severe or catastrophic adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals

Computer security challenges
1. computer security is not as simple as it might first appear to the novice
2. in developing a particular security mechanism or algorithm, one must always consider potential attacks on those security features
3. procedures used to provide particular services are often counterintiuitive
4. physical and logical placement needs to be determined
5. security and mechanisms typically involve more than a particular algorithm or protocol and also require that participants

7. security is still too often an afterthought to be incorporated into a system after the design is complete, rather than being an integral part of the design process
8. security requires regular and constant monitoring
9. there is a natural tendency on the part of users and system managers to perceive little benefit from security investment until a security failure occurs
10. many users and even security administrators view strong

computer security terminology
- adversary (threat agent)
	- individual, group, organization or government that conducts or has the intent to conduct detrimental activities
- attack
	- any kind of malicious activity that attempts to collect, disrupt, deny, degrade or destroy info system resources or the info itself
- countermeasure
	- a device or technique that has as its objective the impairment of the operational effectiveness of undesirable or adversarial activity, or the prevention of espionage, sabotage, theft, or unauthorized access to or use of sensitive info or info systems
- risk
	- a measure of the extent to which an entity is threatened by a potential circumstance or event, and typically a function of 1) the adverse impacts that would arise if the circumstance or event occurs and 2) the likelihood of occurrence
- security policy
	- a set of criteria for the provision of security services. it defines and constrains the activities of a data processing facility in order to maintain a condition of security of systems and data
- system resource (asset)
	- a major application, general support system, high impact program, physical plant, mission critical system, personnel, equipment, or a logically related group of systems
- threat
	- any circumstance or event with the potential to adversely impact organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation) , organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation through an info system via unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure, modification of info, and or denial of service
- vulnerability
	- weakness in an info system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited or triggered by a threat source
