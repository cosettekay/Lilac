binary system
- a bit is the basic unit of info theory, computing, and digital communication
	- bits are the binary digits
- the number system is simply a system to represent or express numbers
- there are various types of number systems and the most commonly used ones are decimal number system, binary number system, octal number system, and hexadecimal number system
- hardware can only deal with binary digits, 0 and 1 (low v and high v
- must represent all numbers, integers, positive or negative, or characters by binary digits (bits)

0 = 0000, 1 = 0001, 2 = 0010, 3 = 0011, 4 = 0100....

number systems
- decimal system: made of 10 digits (0, 1, 2, 3 ,4...9)
- ..., thousands, hundreds, tens, ones
- 41 = 40 + 1
- = 4(10^1) + 1(10^0)

- binary system: made of two digits (0 and 1)
- 00101001 = 0(2^7) + 0(2^6) + 1(2^5)...

- 11111111 = 255, largest number with 8 bits

decimal 41 is also written as 41(down arrow 10) or 41(down arrow ten)
Base(radix) for binary system is 2
thus, 41(down arrow ten) = 101001(down arrow 2)

1011001 = 1(2^6) +0(2^5) + 1(2^4)+ 1(2^3) +0(2^2) + 0(2^1)+ 1(2^0)
= 64 + 16 + 8  + 1
= 89

00001011 = 1(2^3) + 1(2^1) + 1(2^0)
= 8 + 2 + 1
= 11

00001110 = 1(2^3) + 1(2^2) + 1(2^1)
= 8 + 4 + 2
= 14

00010001 = 1(2^4) + 1(2^0)
= 16 + 1
= 17

00101010 = 1(2^5) + 1(2^3) + 1(2^1)
= 32 + 8 + 2
= 42

01001001 = 1(2^6) + 1(2^3) + 1(2^0)
= 64 + 8 + 1
= 73
